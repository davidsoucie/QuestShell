So first off all i will give you files to anaylze. its lua code and these are guide files

each line like this : 

R Astranaar |QID|1070| |N|Travel to Astranaar (34.5, 48)| |Z|Ashenvale|

is a step.

Its build like the following : 

R = RUN

Astranaar (the word after R) is location to Run to

|QID|1070| = is the quest id

|N|Travel to Astranaar (34.5, 48)| = N is NOTE, followed by the note text, inside the note are also coordinates.

|Z|Ashenvale| = Z means ZONE and is followed by the Zones name.

A Ziz Fizziks |QID|1483| |N|Sputtervalve in Ratchet (62.95, 37.23)| |Z|The Barrens| |O|

A = ACCEPT followed by Quest Title then again Quest id then Note again and zone and after that can also come O for optional.

Info for you : the note can include various elements like a name or a location.

T Ziz Fizziks |QID|1483| |N|Ziz Fizziks in Windshear Crag (59.00, 62.50)| |Z|Stonetalon Mountains| |O|

T = TURNIN followed by quest name and id like usual followed by note and zone and optional.

C Super Reaper 6000 |QID|1093| |N|Kill Venture Co. Operator until you find Super Reaper 6000 Blueprints for Ziz Fizziks in Windshear Crag (62.63, 52.07)| |Z|Stonetalon Mountains|

C = COMPLETE, followed by quest name and id and note and zone.

Info for you : Inside the note of a C/COMPLETE step there will be elements like what to do.

for example in this case : Kill Venture Co. Operator , loot Super Reaper 6000 Blueprints (which is an item).

it can also be like this : 

C Gnome's Respite |QID|1071| |N|Kill 10 Venture Co. Deforester and 10 Venture Co. Logger in Windshear Crag (67.90, 51.44) (68.99, 56.77)| |Z|Stonetalon Mountains|

now you see there are an amount of enemies to kill.

f Stonetalon Peak |TID|1134| |N|Speak to Teloren and grab flight path for Stonetalon Peak (36.46, 7.20)| |Z|Stonetalon Mountains|

lower case f means FLIGHTPATH followed by the destination to be picked up (in world of warcraft you can pick u flight paths / discover them), TID means travel id.

F Rut'theran Village |TID|5931| |N|Speak to Silva Fil'naveth and fly to Rut'theran Village (58.33, 93.89)| |C|Druid|

Upper case F means FLY, followed by the destination to fly to (you talk to an npc and select the destination to fly to)

|C|Druid| C means Class, some steps can be Class restricted , the are followed by the class , in this case Druid.

L 5 Mossy Tumor |QID|923| |N|Kill Timberling Mire Beast or Timberling Trampler in Wellspring River and collect 5 Mossy Tumor (43.65, 34.46)| |L|5172 5|

L is for LOOT , followed by the item name to be looted. even though the note says "Kill x" the important part is "collect [number] [item-name] , at the end |L|5172 5| means again LOOT followed by the items id and then the number of items to loot.

sometimes like in this case : 

L 1 Ferocitas the Dream Eater |QID|2459.2| |N|Kill Ferocitas the Dream Eater north of Starbreeze Village and collect Tallonkai's Jewel (69.8, 53.0)| |L|8050 1|

The start declaration will not be right as in this case L followed by amount 1 is suddenly followed by the enemy you have to kill to get the item Tallonkai's Jewel that is declared in the Note.

Another edge case is this : 

L 6 Gnarlpine Ambusher |QID|487| |N|Kill 6 Gnarlpine Ambusher in in Ban'ethil Hollow (45.92, 52.80)| |L|5166 6|

as you can see its declared as LOOT (L) even though we can detect in the note that its a kill type of step, Kill 6 Gnarlpine Ambusher. nothing else that indicates loot.

also : 

L 1 Voodoo Charm |QID|2541| |N|Kill Gnarlpine Shaman until you find a Voodoo Charm, the item only drop froms shaman and very low drop rate. The quest chain will reward Sleeping Robes and Brushwood Blade, consider skipping this quest and the follow up if the rewards is useless for your character (44, 59)| |L|8149 1|
L 1 Rune of Nesting |QID|483.4| |N|Head down into the Ban'ethil Barrow Den at the first set of bridges take the left bridge and collect Rune of Nesting from the chest (44.40, 60.62)| |L|5169 1|
L 1 Black Feather Quill |QID|483.2| |N|Collect Black Feather Quill from the chest across the other bridge (43.76, 61.20)| |L|5170 1|
L 1 Raven Claw Talisman |QID|483.1| |N|Collect Raven Claw Talisman from the chest (45.51, 58.96) (46.22, 58.21) (45.71, 57.33)| |L|5171 1|
L 1 Sapphire of Sky |QID|483.3| |N|Collect Sapphire of Sky from the small chest (44.65, 62.50)| |L|5172 1|

loot type of steps usually dont have the quest name anywhere. Instead they have quest ids.

since the steps are in order somewhere above must have been a quest like this : 

A The Relics of Wakening |QID|483| |N|Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar (55.95, 57.28)|

which is the base quest. the loot quest have either the same questid or questid with a "." and a number like 483.1 etc.

Here is another C / COMPLETE step : 

C Mist |QID|938| |N|Escort Mist to Sentinel Arynia Cloudsbreak at the moon well near the Oracle Tree (31.4, 31.6) (38.3, 34.4)|

in this case the objective would be to escort npc "Mist" to a location, so the important part would be [Escort][NPC].

then we have : 

h Dolanaar |QID|929| |N|Speeak to Innkeeper Keldamyr and set hearth in Dolanaar (55.7, 59.8)|

h = SET_HEARTH In world of wacraft , you can talk to "Innkeeper" npcs, in this case "Innkeeper Keldamyr" and they will have a dialog to set the hearthstone to their location.

For now digest this information and analyze the files I give you to see if you can understand it and also if you can find more step types or let me know if there is anything unclear.
